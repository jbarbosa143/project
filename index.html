                    <ul>
                        <h3>Leader Cliff</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>1st Encounter is Aerodactyl</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Aerodactyl is Cliff's current first offering, and it's a Rock/Flying-type</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>2nd Encounter can be Gallade/Cradily/Slowking</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>The first option for the second Pokemon Cliff can throw at you is Gallade, a Psychic/Fighting-type. Gallade is weak to Fighting, Fairy, and Ghost-type moves, but it's not advised to use Fighting-types because they are inherently weak to Gallade's moves too. You also need to be careful if the opposing Gallade knows Charm, because it's a powerful move that can end your battle quickly</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Cradily is a Rock/Grass-type Pokemon with a varied move pool, which makes it somewhat tricky to counter</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Of Cliff's second Pokemon options, Slowking is the easiest to counter because it is outright weak to Dark and Ghost-type moves. It does have a wide range of moves like Psychic, Blizzard, and Fire Blast.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Final encounter can be Tyranitar/Mamoswine/Dusknoir</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Cliff can also use one of three Pokemon for his final choice. First up is Tyranitar, infamously one of the strongest Pokemon in the game. Fighting-types are undoubtedly the best choice here since they deal 4x damage to Tyranitar.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Since all of Dusknoir's possible moves are Dark-type, the best counters are all Normal or Dark-types thanks to the resistance. You could opt for other Ghost-type Pokemon because Ghost is strong against (and weak to) Ghost, but it's a dangerous game to play.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>As an Ice/Ground-type Pokemon, Mamoswine is weak to Fire, Fighting, Grass, Steel, and Water-type moves, which gives you a wide range of possible Pokemon to counter it. Mamoswine can possess a bunch of different move types though.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Leader Arlo</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>1st Encounter is Beldum</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Beldum is a Steel/Psychic-type Pokemon, but thankfully it has a very limited move pool in this battle. Fire and Ghost-type moves are the way forward, because they'll also take reduced damage.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>2nd Encounter can be Gardevoir/Infernape/Aggron</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>To counter everything Gardevoir can throw at you, you essentially want to solely use Steel-type Pokemon. These are strong against Gardevoir and also resist move of its move pool.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>As you'd expect, Infernape is weak to both Water and Psychic-type Pokemon thanks to it being a dual Fire/Fighting-type. Since Infernape can sometimes use Solar Beam though, Psychic-type Pokemon are recommended to take it down.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Aggron can be a pain in the butt because it is an incredibly powerful Pokemon that can use Rock, Dragon, Steel, and Electric-type moves.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Final encounter can be Salamence/Armaldo/Scizor</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Now we're onto Arlo's third slot. Despite often knowing two Fire-type moves, Salamence is a Dragon-/Flying-type which means it takes 4x damage from Ice-type Pokemon. The problem is that Ice-types are weak to Fire-type moves, unless they have a secondary type that is Fire-type resistant. Taking into account Salamence's possible Fire-type moves.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Armaldo is a Bug/Rock-type Pokemon that knows moves from a number of different types. You'll want to go all out here to take it down, so opt for Water or Steel-type counters.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Last but not least, Arlo can use Scizor. This a Steel-/Bug-type Pokemon which means that Fire-type moves reign supreme, dealing 4x damage. Whip out your strongest Fire-type Pokemon and go to town.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Leader Sierra</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>1st Encounter is Carvanha</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Carvanha isn't a particularly strong Pokemon to begin with and since it's a Water/Dark-type, there are a lot of possible counters.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>2nd Encounter can be Hippowdon/Porygon-Z/Mismagius</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Hippowdon is only a Ground-type Pokemon, but its move pool is so varied and wild that there's a chance even the best Hippowdon counter may be weak to its moves in battle.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Since Porygon-Z is a Normal-type Pokemon, it is only weak to Fighting-types. It has a powerful move pool, but if you go all out with your strongest Fighting-type Pokemon, you should be able to take it down.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Like Dusknoir when fighting Cliff, Mismagius can be taken down easily by using Normal and Dark-type Pokemon, since it only has Ghost-type moves.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Final encounter can be Flygon/Houndoom/Walrein</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Houndoom, on the other hand, is a Fire-/Dark-type Pokemon, so Bug-types would be the worst option here. Any Fighting-, Ground-, Rock-, and Water-type moves will deal double damage against Houndoom, so if you faced off against Sharpedo in slot two, hopefully your Fighting-type counter will still be healthy to deal damage to Sharpedo.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Flygon is a Ground/Dragon-type with some powerful moves; ideally, you'll still have one shield left here to block a charged attack. You'll want to use Fairy, Ice, and Dragon-type Pokemon, but only go for the latter if the Flygon you're against knows Mud Shot. Otherwise Flygon's Dragon-type moves will see you off.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Walrein is an Ice/Water-type Pokemon, so Grass, Fighting, Rock, and Steel-type moves are the best to use. Unfortunately, Fire-type Pokemon aren't recommended thanks to Walrein's Water-type moves.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ol>
